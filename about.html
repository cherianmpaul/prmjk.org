<h2>About Penetration & Restoration Ministries </h2>
<h3>Initial Time & The Expansion of Ministry</h3>
<p>Rev. P. M. Philip originally from Kerala (South India), completed his Graduation from Union Biblical Seminary, Yavatmal (Central India), came to Jammu Kashmir in 1972 in obedience to a definite call from the Lord. God continued to enlarge his vision. That is to reach the unreached, to evangelize the un-evangelized and to plant House Churches of  New Testament Pattern. His wife Mrs. Sosamma Philip also resigned her job (Staff Nurse in the Army) and both together with their little daughter, Premy came to a remote town Ramagar in J & K. The initial story was one of hardness and hopelessness with no means to see a light ahead. Now they look back with thankful heart to God for all his faithfulness. They left everything, sold their property in South India and came to this strange place &#34;Jammu & Kashmir&#34; at the extreme north India where the language, the climate, the food, the culture etc are completely different.
</p>
<p>Many a time they wanted to quit and go back. But like JeremSiah &#34; I will not speak any more in His name, then His Word in my heart like a fire shut up in my bones&#34; (Jeremiah 20:9). So they could not give up preaching the Gospel in Jammu & Kashmir.</p>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>Penetration and Restoration Ministry stand to mobilize the un- reached people group of Jammu & Kashmir through Evangelism, Church planting, Training, Film ministry, and Evangelism.</p>

<h3>Statement of faith</h3>
<p>That the Holy Bible with the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the inspired Word of God, inerrant in the original documents and of final authority in all matters of faith and practice;
One God, eternally co-existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit;
In the full Deity and perfect humanity of our Lord, His representative and substitutionary sacrifice, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the Father's right hand, His present High Priestly ministry, and His personal return to the earth in power and glory.
All men are sinful by nature and under God's condemnation.
In the regeneration by the Holy Spirit, which is absolutely necessary for the salvation of fallen, sinful, and lost mankind and which is a free gift of God's grace received by personal faith through Christ Jesus.
Water baptism is the outward expression of an inward experience in which a believer become a partaker in the Death, Burial and Resurrection  of Jesus Christ.
The Lord's Supper is to be conducted till the second coming of Jesus Christ.
Baptism in the Holy Spirit is necessary for every believer.
In the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.
In the bodily resurrection of the just and unjust: those who are saved to everlasting blessedness, and those who are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.
And that the universal church is composed of all true believers in Christ Jesus who are united in Him and to one another by the indwelling Holy Spirit. The chief functions of the church are to worship God and witness for the Lord Jesus Christ until He returns. .
World Evangelism, Church planting and making Disciples are the supreme duty and privilege of every believer

<h3>The Challenges We Face In the Ministry</h3>
<h4> Cross Cultural Evangelism:</h4>
<p>We have been doing the Lord's ministry in Jammu Kashmir (extreme North India) for the last 35 years. We left everything, sold our property in Kerala (Extreme South India) and came to this strange place where the language, the climate, the food, the culture etc are completely different.
</p>
<h4>High Mountains, Extreme Cold Climate And Very Little Transportation:</h4>
<p>Jammu Kashmir is a place of high mountains with extreme cold climate and with very little facilities for a normal life. There is no transportation facility to most  of  the mountain villages. we have to walk on foot to reach such mountains. In winter season the temperature goes down to 0 c in some of our mission stations where there  is no heating arrangement except burning of some firewood.
 </p>
<h4>Poverty and Illiteracy:</h4>
<p>The common people of this place live Below Poverty Line with minimum food, cloth and shelter. about 50 % of the people in the villages are either illiterate or half illiterate. So we had to start adult education along with gospel preaching.
</p>
<h4>Superstitious Beliefs:</h4>
<p>About 40% of the population in this area (Jammu region) practice superstitious beliefs.  Christian population is less than 1% and they are only a minority.
</p>
<h4> Untouchability:</h4>
<p>Untouchability still prevails in the society and it is  one of the main stumbling blocks in our ministry. 
</p><p>
Each one reach one, is the secret of the Church growth here. When one person gets saved, he goes share the gospel with another pray for the sick and bring him to the Church. It is not the shepherd giving birth to a sheep. But the sheep gives birth to another sheep and that is how the Church grows. Shepherd is there to feed the sheep.</p>

<h3>The Condition of the Churches in this Area</h3>
<p>
1)  Hope you know we are working in a pioneer mission field where there are no traditional Christians.
</br></br>
2)  In most of the house churches the members are either seekers or new believers.
</br></br>
3) About half of our believers are either illiterate or half illiterate. We slowly educate them by starting adult education centers in different places.
</br></br>
4) An average believer does cultivation, feed the cattle or does some labor work.
</br></br>
5)  Most of their houses are made out of mud, stone, timber and not with cement or bricks. Most of our house churches are in this condition. So they are not able to support one pastor family.
</br></br>
6) Our house churches (Prayer Halls) are very small in number. Average may be 15-20 believers.  
</br></br>
7) Our Base Church has good number of committed and witnessing believers. </br>
Our Base Church here in Ramnagar Town and the branch Church in Pattoli Town near Jammu city are the only two Church Buildings made of Bricks, steel & cement.
